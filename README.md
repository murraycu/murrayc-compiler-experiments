Code experiments to exercise ideas while reading "Engineering a Compiler".

This is mostly just C++ implementations of the pseudocode in the book.
It probably won't make much sense unless you have the book.

Currently the code is just meant to implement the algorithms, so I can be
sure that I understand the pseudocode and its description in the book,
trying to write fairly concise but correct code. It is not meant to be
efficient, but I might get around to that too if it doesn't make the code
less readable.
